      <p>
        I&apos;m passionate about leading with positivity and empathy with the
        goal of having a deeper understanding of ourselves, each other, and
        technology. I&apos;m always seeking opportunities to learn new
        technologies, collaborate in diverse groups, and make technology more{" "}
        <em>accessible</em> and <em>fun</em>.

      <p>
        When I&apos;m not coding, I love to paint, go on *small* hikes, and read
        about Feminism, Art history, and humanity.{" "}
